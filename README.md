# Second-Chance-Clock-OS-Algorithm
Utilizing a set of page frames, reference bits, and a clock hand. Users can input the number of page frames and a reference string to simulate page accesses. The algorithm tracks page faults and dynamically manages page frames, replacing pages based on a clock-like mechanism.
